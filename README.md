I am using the five-thirty-eight data set contained here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption as a basis for my data.

I am trying to visualize this data using React.  This is letting me practice all of those fun React skills like dealing with state and passing that state from child components to parent components.

Hopefully this turns out kinda cool.
